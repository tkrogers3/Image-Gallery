Continuing to learn Javascript, this project brought along the first uses of loops and conditionals, as well as functions events
that I learned in the last project. 
<br>
This project required more event listeners as each photo needed its own event to target. 
<br>
In order to create the a new element for each image, I looped through an array of 5 items and created a new element.
<br>
Also within the loop, to set attributes to each image,I concatinated the source/folder/index/.jpeg to use the file new 
for each image, then through the loop an onClick was added so that when the thumbnail image was clicked, it would 
replace the current displayed image.
<br>
A conditional statement is used for the onClick to run a function with an if statement to lighten or darken
an image.
